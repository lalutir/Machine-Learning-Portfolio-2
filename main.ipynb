    "   - Correlation: **0.4** (moderate positive)\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **`hum` (Humidity)**:\n",
    "   - Correlation: **-0.33** (moderate negative)\n",
    "   - Interpretation: Higher humidity levels are associated with a decrease in rentals. This indicates that humid weather may discourage people from renting.\n",

    "4. **`windspeed`**:\n",
    "   - Correlation: **0.097** (weak positive)\n",
    "   - Interpretation: Windspeed shows a very weak positive correlation with rentals. This suggests that windspeed has a minimal linear relationship with the count of rentals.\n",

    "   - Correlation: **-0.14** (weak negative)\n",
    "   - Interpretation: Since this column is a column consisting of four classes, a pearson correlation coefficient is not the best way to figure out relations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **`holiday`**:\n",
    "   - Correlation: **-0.027** (very weak negative)\n",
    "   - Interpretation: The correlation between holidays and rentals is negligible, indicating that the number of rentals is not significantly affected by whether it is a holiday.

    "   - Since `temp` and `atemp` have a high correlation towards eachothter (0.99), one of them can be rendered negligible.\n",
    "- Features such as `windspeed`, `weathersit`, and `holiday` show weak or negligible correlations, indicating they may have limited linear influence on the target variable."

    "The exploratory data analysis (EDA) has provided valuable insights into the dataset, its structure, and the relationships between features. Based on the findings, the following data preprocessing steps will be applied to prepare the dataset for further analysis and modeling:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Column Dropping**:\n",
    "   - The following columns will be removed as they either lack meaningful contribution, exhibit high correlation with other features, or show redundant information:\n",
    "     - `holiday`: Weak correlation with the target variable and limited predictive power.\n",
    "     - `year`, `month`, `day_of_week`, `day`: These columns demonstrate trends or patterns already captured by other features, such as `hour` or aggregated time-series patterns.\n",
    "     - `atemp`: Highly correlated with `temp` (0.99), making it redundant.\n",
    "     - `windspeed`: Weak correlation with the target variable, indicating limited linear influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dummy Variable Creation**:\n",
    "   - Dummy variables will be created for the `weathersit` column to capture its categorical nature effectively and ensure its compatibility with predictive modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering with Fourier Analysis**:\n",
    "   - Fourier waves will be generated based on the following columns to capture their periodicity:\n",
    "     - `week` (annual periodicity).\n",
    "     - `hour` (daily periodicity).\n",
    "   - After generating the Fourier waves, the original `week` and `hour` columns will be dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Indexing**:\n",
    "   - The `date_hour` column will be converted to the `datetime` format and set as the index for the dataset to facilitate time series analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps will ensure the dataset is optimized for modeling by retaining meaningful features, addressing redundancy, and incorporating temporal patterns effectively.\n"
