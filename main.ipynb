    "   - Correlation: **-0.33** (moderate negative)\n",

    "The kNN Regressor uses distance to predict new values. This is effective as long as all features in the dataset have similar scales. If the features have different scales, those with larger values will dominate the distance metric. For example, if one feature is body height (measured in meters) and another is body weight (measured in kilograms), the distance metric will be skewed toward body weight unless both features are standardized. Without standardization, predictions can be heavily influenced by certain features, reducing the accuracy of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, standardization improves accuracy and prevents bias by ensuring all features contribute equally to the distance calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regularization in k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN Regressor)**\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, **regularization** is used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to complex models. However, for non-parametric models like k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), regularization is handled differently since KNN does not fit a parametric function. Instead, it makes predictions based on the proximity of data points in the feature space. While KNN does not explicitly include regularization terms like in parametric models, certain parameters control model complexity and improve generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Regularization Aspects in KNN**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choice of K (Number of Neighbors)**:\n",
    "   - The value of $K$ is crucial in controlling the **bias-variance trade-off**. A lower $K$ makes the model more sensitive to noise, as it focuses on fewer neighbors, leading to high variance and potential overfitting. A higher $K$ smooths the predictions, reducing variance but increasing bias, which can help prevent overfitting to training data.\n",
    "   - Therefore, selecting an optimal $K$ acts as an implicit form of regularization, with smaller values favoring higher complexity and larger values enforcing smoother, generalized predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regularization by Cross-Validation**\n",
    "- **Cross-validation** can be used in conjunction with the choice of $K$ to find the optimal balance, effectively acting as a regularization process. By tuning $K$ to minimize overfitting and maximize predictive performance, cross-validation helps ensure generalization of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while kNN does not explicitly apply regularization terms like in parametric models, the selection of $K$, feature scaling, and cross-validation all contribute to regularizing the model, controlling complexity, and improving generalization performance in kNN regression *(Baladram, 2024a)*."

    "A Decision Tree Regressor is a non-parametric model used for regression tasks. It makes predictions by recursively partitioning the data into smaller subsets based on feature values. Each internal node in the tree corresponds to a decision made based on a specific feature, while each leaf node represents a predicted continuous outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Splitting Criteria**\n",
    "\n",
    "The effectiveness of a Decision Tree Regressor hinges on the criteria used to determine the best splits. The most prevalent splitting criteria are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:  \n",
    "   MSE quantifies the variance of the target variable within the node. When splitting a node, the algorithm chooses the feature and threshold that minimizes the MSE in the resulting child nodes. Lower MSE values indicate a better split, as they lead to purer nodes with smaller variance in the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**:  \n",
    "   MAE measures the average absolute differences between the predicted values and the actual target values. Like MSE, the algorithm seeks to minimize the MAE in the child nodes after a split, aiming for more accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pruning and Overfitting**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pruning** is a critical technique used to simplify the Decision Tree model by removing sections of the tree that do not contribute significantly to predictive power. This practice helps mitigate the risk of overfitting. Pruning can be categorized into two primary forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pre-Pruning (Early Stopping)**:  \n",
    "   Pre-pruning involves halting the growth of the tree before it reaches its maximum depth. This can be achieved by imposing constraints such as limiting the depth of the tree, setting a minimum number of samples required to perform a split, or requiring a minimum number of samples at a leaf node. These measures prevent the model from becoming overly complex and prone to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Post-Pruning**:  \n",
    "   In this approach, the tree is fully grown before assessing its structure. Post-pruning entails the removal of branches that contribute minimally to the model's performance. This is accomplished by evaluating the tree's performance on validation data and eliminating branches that do not enhance generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Considerations for Pruning*\n",
    "\n",
    "While pruning is effective for reducing overfitting, it is crucial to avoid excessive pruning, as this can lead to **underfitting**. Underfitting occurs when the tree is overly simplistic and fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data, thereby impairing the model’s ability to make accurate predictions *(Baladram, 2024b)*.\n"

This randomness in feature selection reduces the correlation among the trees, which improves the model's accuracy and generalization ability. The ability to use different subsets of features in each tree helps Random Forest to effectively handle complex data with many features.\n",
